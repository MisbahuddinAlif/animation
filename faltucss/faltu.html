    <p id ="firstpara">The surroundings in which life exists on earth are called the environment. The environment contains air, water, sunlight, trees, animals, and human beings. They are the living and non-living creatures of the earth. The trees, human- beings, and animals are living organisms. The sun, water, and air are non-living organisms that are crucial for man’s survival. Every creature is a natural resource for each other. For example, deer is a natural resource to be eaten by a lion. Life on the earth would not be able to exist in the absence of any one of these natural resources.</p>

    <p id="secondpara">All the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) entities constitute the environment. Biotic things include- humans, plants, animals, and insects. They are classified as biological components of the environment. Every biotic creature has its own fixed life cycle. For example, human-being is the strongest living organism on earth. He needs plants and animals in order to fulfill his needs. His life-cycle will be disorganized without them.</p>

    <p id="thirdpara">An ecosystem is a large community in which some or all forms of life work together to make a living. There is a terrestrial ecosystem on earth. The trees, plants, shrubs large and small animals, insects live together and depend on each other. Forests are the natural habitat of animals. Rooting out animals from their natural home will be a major disaster to their ecosystem.</p>

    <p>Jackfruit is found all over in Bangladesh; but mainly in the month of Jaishtha and Ashar. It grows in plenty on the hilly areas of Chittagong and Sylhet and on the highland of Dhaka, Mymensingh, Comilla and Jessore. Beside these, it grows in India, Srilanka, Burma and Brazil. It has a rough and prickly skin. Inside the skin the fruit is found to be composed of many juicy flakes. When it becomes ripe, it turns out to be delicious and succulent to eat. It is also a very nutritious fruit. We get Vitamin ‘’A’’ and “C’’ from Jackfruit cell. We can also make jam, jelly, and juice by Jackfruit’s cell. The Jackfruit trees are very large. The leaves of Jackfruit trees are good food for cow and goat. From the stalk of Jackfruit trees we can make furniture. Jackfruit is in great demand with the common people. The price is comparatively cheap. Beside this, it can be served as a food. I like Jackfruit very much.</p>

    <p>Banana is the most popular fresh fruit in all over the world and its name comes from the Arabic word 'banan', which means finger. The scientific name of Banana is Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. But the old scientific names of banana are Musa sapientum and Musa paradisiacal. It is not used longer. Bananas are rich source carbohydrates and potassium. They are the first choice by athletics due to its high energy giving capability. The funny thing to notice about banana is its shape (like an arc) which makes its appearance appealing. And why not, they are the favorite fruit of monkeys!</p>
